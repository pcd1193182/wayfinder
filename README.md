# Wayfinder

## Description
Wayfinder is (currently) a python script that can find the shortest path between two points in the eve universe, using a map generated from the Eve SDE and eve-scout data.  It requires python3.

## Future work
The goal for this tool is to add support for Siggy chainmaps, and to provide a way to run this as a server with a decent web UI. The end goal would be to allow corps to run their own instance of this tool and make use of it.

## Dependencies
This project takes in a json file describing the Eve universe generated by a slightly modified version of https://github.com/mickdekkers/eve-map-json/ ; the only modification is to remove the filtering of wormhole and other special systems.
