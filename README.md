# Wayfinder

## Description
Wayfinder is (currently) a python script that can find the shortest path between two points in the eve universe, using a map generated from the Eve SDE and eve-scout data.  It requires python3.

## Future work
The goal for this tool is to add support for Siggy chainmaps, and to provide a way to run this as a server with a decent web UI. The end goal would be to allow corps to run their own instance of this tool and make use of it.
