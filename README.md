# Wayfinder

## Description
Wayfinder is (currently) a python script that can find the shortest path between two points in the eve universe, using a map generated from the Eve SDE and eve-scout data.  It requires python3.

## Future work
The goal for this tool is to add support for Siggy chainmaps, and to provide a way to run this as a server with a decent web UI. The end goal would be to allow corps to run their own instance of this tool and make use of it.

## Dependencies
This project takes in a json file describing the Eve universe generated by a slightly modified version of https://github.com/mickdekkers/eve-map-json/ ; the only modification is to remove the filtering of wormhole and other special systems.

## Usage
Place the json file produced by eve-map-json in the root directory, and then run wayfinder.py.

Example usage:
`./wayfinder.py Jita Amarr`

The first argument is the starting location; the second is the destination. After that, a list of systems to avoid my be provided; if the destination cannot be reached without travelling through them, no route will be given.  Several arguments are available:

### -h
Presents the usage information

### -c, --allow-crit
Allows the usage of crit wormholes in the route calculation. By default these wormholes are ignored.

### -e, --allow-eol
Allows the usage of EOL wormholes in the route calculation. By default these wormholes are ignored.

### --shortest, --safest, --insecure
Defines the routing algorithm to be used. Only one may be specified, and only once. Shortest tries to find the shortest path, no matter what (though it will prefer higher-security and wormhole systems when the routes are the same number of jumps). Secure tries to stick to high security space as much as possible. Insecure attempts to avoid highsec whenever possible.
